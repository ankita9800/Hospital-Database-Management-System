## Hospital-Database-Management-System

This project is a prototype database for a hospital management system. It is implemented in MySQL and contains 11 tables that store information about patients, doctors, diagnoses, medications, treatments, and payments. The system provides an organized approach to data management, which can lead to cost savings and enhanced hospital efficiency.

The project also demonstrates the use of SQL, NoSQL, and Python. This allows the system to be tailored to different use cases and preferences. It is recommended to continue exploring other database management systems to determine which system is best suited for the specific needs of the hospital.

Tools used: MySQL database, MongoDb, Studio3T, Jupyter Notebook
Programming languages used: SQL, NoSQL, and Python
